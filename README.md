# My multicolor gcode merger
3D printing with one extruder is fine, but when you want to print somthing, that contains few colors per layer, its becoming problematic. This application **do not serve** all the features of multi-extruder colored printing, but helps making first few layers multicolor. Working with printers, supporting **M600** command. Tested with Cura Slicer.
